## Target Strategy

### Dual Bounty Approach

Our **"The Sovereign Architect (Chimera)"** project is designed to target **BOTH** bounties by:

1. **Using ChainGPT APIs** for intelligent contract generation and auditing (Bounty #2)
2. **Implementing Quack Q402** for sign-to-pay execution (Bounty #2)
3. **Deploying ERC-8004 agent identity** via AWE Network (Bounty #1)
4. **Accepting x402 micropayments** for agent services (Bounty #1)

### Competitive Advantages

- ✅ **Full Stack Integration**: ChainGPT + Quack + AWE = Complete solution
- ✅ **Security First**: Policy-based execution with transaction previews
- ✅ **Real Utility**: DeFi strategy research, generation, audit, and deployment
- ✅ **Monetization Model**: x402 micropayments for premium agent services
- ✅ **Modern UX**: Fintech-style interface that demystifies Web3

### Success Metrics

To win both bounties, we need to demonstrate:

1. **Working x402 payment flow** (both bounties)
2. **ChainGPT integration** with LLM + Generator/Auditor (Bounty #2)
3. **ERC-8004 agent identity** on-chain (Bounty #1)
4. **Policy-protected execution** with security features (Bounty #2)
5. **Compelling demo video** showing the complete user journey (both bounties)
6. **Clean, documented code** on GitHub (both bounties)

## Next Steps

1. Review both bounty requirements carefully
2. Ensure all technical requirements are met
3. Test the complete flow end-to-end
4. Prepare comprehensive documentation
5. Record professional demo video
6. Submit before deadline
