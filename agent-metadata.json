  "knowledgeBase": "# The Sovereign Architect - Project Knowledge Base\n\n## Project Overview\nThe Sovereign Architect (codename: Chimera) is an AI Agent built for the BNB Chain Hackathon that researches, architects, audits, and deploys DeFi strategies autonomously. It combines ChainGPT (Intelligence), Quack Q402 (Execution), and AWE Network (Identity) into a unified system.\n\n## Core Mission\nEnable users to interact with blockchain technology through natural language, where the AI agent generates smart contracts, audits them for security vulnerabilities, and executes gasless transactions on behalf of users.\n\n## Technical Stack\n\n### Intelligence Layer - ChainGPT\n- Web3 AI Chatbot (@chaingpt/generalchat): Domain-specific LLM for crypto/blockchain conversations\n- Smart Contract Generator (@chaingpt/smartcontractgenerator): Natural language to Solidity code generation\n- Smart Contract Auditor (@chaingpt/smartcontractauditor): Automated vulnerability detection and security analysis\n- Streaming Support: Real-time token-by-token responses using Server-Sent Events (SSE)\n\n### Execution Layer - Quack Q402\n- EIP-7702 Delegated Execution: Gasless transaction protocol\n- Sign-to-Pay Mechanics: Users sign a policy/intent, agent pays the gas\n- Policy Enforcement: Cryptographic boundaries (spend caps, allow/deny lists, time restrictions)\n- Facilitator Service: Stateless verification and settlement on BNB Smart Chain\n\n### Identity Layer - AWE Network\n- ERC-8004 Standard: On-chain agent identity with verifiable reputation\n- x402 Protocol: HTTP 402 Payment Required for micropayment acceptance\n- Service Token Economics: Agents can monetize their services through blockchain-native payments\n- BNB Attestation Service (BAS): Identity registry on BSC at 0x6c2270298b1e6046898a322acB3Cbad6F99f7CBD\n\n## Key Web3 Concepts\n\n### Gas Sponsorship\nEvery blockchain operation costs \"gas\" (computing power) paid in BNB. Our agent uses gas sponsorship where users sign a permission slip (intent), and the agent pays the transaction fee on their behalf.\n\n### EIP-712 (Typed Structured Data)\nA standard for hashing and signing data so it's human-readable. Instead of signing random hex strings, users see JSON objects like {\"To\": \"Agent\", \"Amount\": \"5 USDC\"} preventing phishing attacks.\n\n### EIP-7702 (Delegated Execution)\nAllows smart contracts to temporarily execute code in the context of a user's wallet without requiring pre-approval transactions. This enables true gasless payments with any ERC-20 token.\n\n### x402 (Payment Required Protocol)\nRevival of HTTP 402 status code for crypto payments. When requesting premium resources, servers return 402, browsers prompt for crypto payment, and resources unlock after confirmation.\n\n### ERC-8004 (Trustless Agent Standard)\nEthereum standard for verifiable on-chain agent identities with three registries: Identity (NFT passport), Reputation (feedback ledger), and Validation (proof of autonomy).\n\n## Architecture Components\n\n### Backend (Hono Framework)\n- Runtime: Bun for performance with Node.js compatibility\n- API Routes: /api/chat (streaming), /api/generate (contracts), /api/audit (security), /api/execute (transactions)\n- Context Injection: Real-time blockchain state (gas prices, block numbers, timestamps)\n- Security: API keys in environment variables, backend acts as secure proxy\n\n### Frontend (React + Vite)\n- Chat interface with markdown rendering for code blocks\n- Wallet connection via Wagmi (BNB Smart Chain Testnet/Mainnet)\n- Transaction Preview Cards showing safety scores, gas costs, policy limits\n- x402 Payment modals with clear cost explanations\n- Real-time streaming responses using Server-Sent Events\n\n### Blockchain Integration (Viem)\n- Type-safe blockchain interactions\n- Smart contract deployment and verification\n- Transaction broadcasting and monitoring\n- Gas price estimation and optimization\n\n## User Flow Example\n\n1. User Request: \"Create a token called 'PizzaCoin' with 1 million supply\"\n2. Payment Challenge: Agent responds with x402 (Payment Required: $5 USDC)\n3. User Payment: Signs payment authorization (gasless for user)\n4. Code Generation: ChainGPT generates Solidity contract code\n5. Security Audit: ChainGPT auditor analyzes for vulnerabilities (score must be >80%)\n6. Self-Correction Loop: If audit fails, regenerate with fixes until passing\n7. Transaction Preview: Display safety score, gas cost (sponsored), policy limits\n8. User Authorization: User signs EIP-712 structured data (no gas paid)\n9. Facilitator Execution: Agent's wallet submits transaction to BSC\n10. Confirmation: User receives contract address and transaction hash\n\n## Security Features\n\n### Policy-Based Execution\n- Maximum spend limits per transaction\n- Token whitelist/blacklist for allowed interactions\n- Time-based restrictions (expiration deadlines)\n- Recipient address validation\n\n### Audit Loop\n- Automated security scanning of all generated code\n- Minimum safety threshold of 80% score\n- Iterative regeneration with vulnerability feedback\n- Pre-verified \"Golden Paths\" for common contracts\n\n### Transaction Transparency\n- Full preview before any signature\n- Clear explanation of what will execute on-chain\n- Risk warnings for potentially dangerous operations\n- Immutable transaction logs for accountability\n\n## Supported Networks\n\n### BNB Smart Chain Testnet (Chain ID: 97)\n- RPC: https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545\n- Explorer: https://testnet.bscscan.com\n- Faucet: https://www.bnbchain.org/en/testnet-faucet\n- Test USDT: 0x337610d27c682E347C9cD60BD4b3b107C9d34dDd\n\n### BNB Smart Chain Mainnet (Chain ID: 56)\n- RPC: https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org\n- Explorer: https://bscscan.com\n- Production deployment target\n\n## Smart Contract Templates\n\nThe agent can generate and deploy:\n- ERC-20 Tokens (fungible tokens with custom economics)\n- ERC-721 NFTs (unique digital assets)\n- ERC-1155 Multi-tokens (hybrid fungible/non-fungible)\n- Staking Contracts (lock tokens, earn rewards)\n- Vesting Contracts (time-locked token distribution)\n- Voting/Governance (DAO proposal systems)\n- DEX Pools (automated market makers)\n- Lending Protocols (collateralized borrowing)\n\n## Error Handling Strategies\n\n### ChainGPT API Issues\n- Implement caching for repeated queries\n- Set up fallback responses for common questions\n- Monitor API usage with client-side rate limiting\n- Maintain backup API keys\n\n### Q402 Transaction Failures\n- Retry logic with exponential backoff\n- Clear error messages for signature rejections\n- Fallback to manual approval flow if needed\n- Transaction status monitoring and notifications\n\n### AWE Network Fallbacks\n- If ERC-8004 SDK fails, deploy standard ERC-721\n- Use viem for manual contract interactions\n- Demonstrate understanding of underlying protocol\n\n## Target Bounties\n\n### Quack × ChainGPT Super Web3 Agent ($20,000)\nRequirements:\n- Minimum 2 ChainGPT APIs (using all 3: Chat, Generator, Auditor)\n- Real Q402 sign-to-pay implementation\n- Security features (spend caps, allow/deny lists, previews, warnings)\n- Testnet/Mainnet toggle\n- Professional demo video\n\n### AWE Network 800402 Initiative ($10,000)\nRequirements:\n- ERC-8004 agent identity deployment\n- x402 micropayment acceptance\n- Service token issuance on x402 Market\n- Complete payment flow demonstration\n- GitHub repository with documentation\n\n## Competitive Advantages\n1. Full-stack integration of three major protocols\n2. Security-first approach with automated auditing\n3. Real utility beyond chatbot (actual contract deployment)\n4. Gasless UX removing friction for mainstream users\n5. Monetization model enabling sustainable agent economy\n6. Modern fintech-style interface demystifying Web3 complexity\n\n## Development Constraints\n- Strict TypeScript with no 'any' types\n- Environment variables for all secrets\n- ESM modules only (no CommonJS)\n- Bun as primary runtime and package manager\n- Viem for blockchain interactions (not ethers.js)\n- Comment the \"why\" not the \"how\" in code\n- All responses must stream for better UX\n\n## Testing Strategy\n- Unit tests for all core functions\n- Integration tests for Q402 payment flow\n- End-to-end tests for contract generation → audit → deployment\n- Testnet validation before mainnet deployment\n- Low balance alerts for facilitator wallet (<0.05 BNB)\n\n## Project Status\nIn active development for BNB Chain Hackathon. Target completion: 5-7 days for MVP with polish. Focus on demonstrable value over theoretical capabilities.",
